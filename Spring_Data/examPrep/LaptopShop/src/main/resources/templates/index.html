                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, another specialty laptop store, but only at first glance. Here you will
                        find a large selection of the best office, professional or gaming computers and of course, they
                        will all be mobile because mobility is most important nowadays.
                        <br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To offer a better experience to its customers, the store urgently needs a good
                        enough application that collects all the information about all available laptops and can, with
                        one click, dig through the sorted best offers.
                        <br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The store owner has turned to SoftUni for help. Now a small team led by you
                        must take on this task.
