                    <h4>In recent months, the world has been once again conquered by the football magic.
                        Unfortunately, our national team was again not among the best teams, which clearly tells us that
                        we need to find new better players.
                        A small team from SoftUni starts working on the staff selection and invites you to be involved
                        in the program development.
                        The idea of it is to receive a huge amount of information about the players in different formats
                        - JSON or XML.
                        Retrieve the information and record only those that meet certain criteria in the database.
                        Also, when requesting certain data, the program should display the necessary information.</h4>
